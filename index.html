                <h1>Should I still work as a software engineer if I know that I am not smart enough to work for a world class company like Google or Microsoft?</h1>
                <p>
                    Let me share <strong>six secrets</strong> with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>First, a secret about money.</u> The money from your high-paying developer salary will spend the same whether it comes from Amazon or Google, or from some second-tier company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Here’s a secret about Microsoft and Google.</u> Some new grads who get in are very smart, and some are just lucky. You don’t have to be smart to get a job there. I will say, however, that the employees who manage to advance at these big firms are generally very smart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Here’s a secret about your own capabilities.</u> You’re young. You don’t know how to do stuff. That’s OK. The companies who hire new grads don’t expect them to solve hard problems. They expect them to work under more experienced leadership as they grow their capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Here’s a secret about software development.</u> Not all of it is hard. For every ultra-complex operating system kernel and self-driving car, there are 10,000 create/update/delete screens and login pages to write. You don’t have to solve the Halting Problem to make a boatload of money as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Here is a secret about the work at big companies.</u> I met a man who worked at Boeing (airplanes), who was the “747, main cargo door, lower hinge specialist”. He spent about six weeks designing and fabricating the hinge, and 7 years walking it through regulatory approval. Would you want to spend 20 years as the “common file open dialog, cancel button” guy? Is this why you’re trying so hard to get into Microsoft? The smartest person I have ever known got a job at Microsoft, maintaining the FORTRAN floating-point library. Yawn-burger with a side of Zs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>And finally, a secret about me;</i> I remember when I was starting out, and I knew my little brain could never encompass something as complex as…a program with DLLs (lol). I remember not taking the first job ever offered me as a software developer because all the devs had paper printouts 12 inches thick on their filing cabinets, and I knew I could never understand a listing so huge. I don’t make paper listings anymore, but if I did, mine would be easily six feet tall.

                <h1>If people truly love each other, how come divorce and heartbreak has crippled many relationship today?</h1>
                <p>
                    Because love is not the answer, love does not conquer all, and you need more than love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There. I said it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Love is a feeling. You can truly, deeply love someone from the bottom of your heart and still not be a good partner for that person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for a relationship to succeed, you need more than love. You also need basic compatibility, which can include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A shared vision of what you want the relationship to look like
                        </li>
                        <li>Goals, ideals, and values in common
                        </li>
                        <li>Roughly analogous worldviews
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to that, it also takes skill to make a relationship succeed. Some of the skills you’ll need include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Communication
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Conflict management and resolution
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Emotional regulation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The ability to compromise
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The ability to set boundaries
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The ability to advocate for your needs
                        </li>
                        
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without those, love alone is unlikely to take you far.
